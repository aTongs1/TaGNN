Tendency-aware Graph Neural Network for Water Quality Prediction with Coupled Noise

The task of future water quality prediction, which harnesses historical water quality data from various observation nodes in conjunction with their corresponding topological positional relationships to forecast impending water quality fluctuations, represents a pivotal application of graph neural networks in environmental protection. However, this endeavor is complicated by the presence of noise both within the collected numerical data and within the inter-node topological structures, compounded by a coupling phenomenon. Furthermore, the varying directions of pollutant flow introduce an intricate, challenging level of coupling between numerical and structural noise. To this end, we propose a novel Tendency-aware Graph Neural Network approach for water quality prediction that specifically addresses noise coupling: 1) By leveraging historical water quality trend features, the proposed model uncovers local interdependencies among raw water quality indicators to construct multiple potential hydrological topological structures, thereby effectively disentangling structural noise; 2) Utilizing the constructed adjacency matrices alongside original data, the model extracts spatio-temporal features to separate numerical noise. Ultimately, coherent node representations across pre- and post-structure construction phases are aggregated based on the inferred latent structure to deliver water quality predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-art model on real-world datasets and yields hydrological topological structures that align well with actual conditions.
